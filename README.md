### Instructions for working locally
You can also run these notebooks on your own (Linux/Windows/Mac) computer.
This is a bit snappier than running them online.

1. **Prerequisite**: Python>=3.6.  
   If you're not a python expert:  
   1a. Install Python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).  
   1b. Use the [Anaconda terminal](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda) to run the commands below.  
   1c. (Optional) [Create & activate a new Python environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments).  
   If the installation (below) fails, try doing step 1c first.

2. **Install**:  
   `$ git clone https://github.com/nansencenter/DA-tutorials.git`  
   `$ pip install -e DA-tutorials`  
   NB: don't download via your browser (instead of git). This zip won't install.

3. **Launch the Jupyter notebooks**:  
   `jupyter-notebook`  
   This will open up a page in your web browser that is a file navigator.  
   Open (click on) the first tutorial (`T1... .ipynb`), and start going through!
