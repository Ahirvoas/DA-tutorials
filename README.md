Installation
================================================

1. **Prerequisite**: python>=3.6 (suggest setting it up with [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)).  
Execute `python -V` (uppercase `V`) in a [terminal](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#starting-conda) to assert that the version is 3.6 or higher.
2. **Install**:  
   Download and extract (or `git clone`) DA-tutorials,  
   `cd` into the resulting folder,  
   `pip install -e .`
3. **Launch the Jupyter notebooks**:  
   `jupyter-notebook`  
   This will open up a page in your web browser that is a file navigator.  
   Open (click on) the first tutorial (`T1... .ipynb`), and start going through!
